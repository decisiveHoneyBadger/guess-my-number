## 🖥 Description

<strong>guess-my-name</strong> is a plain web application designed as a retro game for users interested in simple logic with fun. Essentially, it is about guessing a number between 1 and 20. Based on DOM Manipulation with vanilla JavaScript the user is able to interact in various ways with the manipulated data on the screen.

## 🎮 Logic and rules   

In order to win the game, the user has to take into account some important points.
(1) The user has to guess a number between 1 and 20 – either by typing manually or using the arrow buttons ⬆️ and ⬇️ the in the input field, finally finishing the input by clicking the "Check!" button.
(2) The user has 20 scores (chances). After each guess, the computer checks the input and helps navigate the user by tipping like 📉 "too low" or 📈 "too high". Subsequently, after each round the score is decreased by 1.
(3) If the user wins, "correct number!" gets displayed and the background color changes. If the user looses, "You lost the game" gets displayed.
(4) The computer saves and displayes the highscore (temporary record).
(5) The user is able to restart the game by clicking the "Again!" button.
